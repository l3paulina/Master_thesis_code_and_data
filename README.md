# ReadMe for the Quantifying Reproducibility of Machine Learning Research Papers Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making Methods Master's Thesis Computation

## Python Library Versions:

## Dataset Files:

### 1. Dataset 1.csv
The first dataset used in the Master thesis from D. Olszewski, et al, for the creation of reproducibility criteria for machine learning research papers. This file already contains data after part of the filtering from the 2.1.2 section was performed in Excel. The "Reproduced" column was filtered to only "0" and "1" values.

### 2. Dataset 2.csv
The second dataset used in the Master thesis from E. Raff, for the creation of reproducibility criteria for machine learning research papers. This file already contains data after most of the data transformations from the 2.1.2 section were performed in Excel. The values were replaced respectively to the instructions given in that section.

### 3. New Annotated Dataset.xlsx
The new dataset created from sampling a subset of from D. Olszewski, et al., containing 139 research papers, described in section 2.2.2, used in the evaluation and example analyses of the created quantitative reproducibility measure with WSM for machine learning research papers. The first page in the Excel file is the author's annotation of the research paper's reproducibility criteria scores, the second page contains "ChatGPT" annotations of the research paper's reproducibility criteria scores, the third page contains the final reproducibility criteria score annotation for the research papers.

### 4. 10 Research Papers Dataset 1.csv
10 research paper dataset randomly sampled from the new annotated dataset, used in the example analysis of the quantitative reproducibility measure for machine learning research papers.

## Code Files:

### 1. Code for Dataset 1 Analysis.ipynb
The code for the data analysis: exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, logistic regression and classification tasks with the dataset 1, from D. Olszewski, et al. Additionally, the random sampling is shown to sample a subset of the dataset 1, containing 139 research papers, described in section 2.2.2, used in the evaluation and example analyses of the created quantitative reproducibility measure with WSM for machine learning research papers.

### 1. Code for Dataset 2 Analysis.ipynb
The code for the data analysis: exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, logistic regression and classification tasks with the dataset 2, from E. Raff.

### 1. Code for Evaluation and Example Analyses.ipynb
The code for the evaluation and example analyses of the created quantitative reproducibility measure with WSM for machine learning research papers.
